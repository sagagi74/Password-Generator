2nd rework:
fixing this error

"One issue I noted was when selecting an improper choice to generate I was getting an undefined value in the input field which you'll prob wanna fix for an even higher grade" comment from Grading Teams



Rework:

1. I have renamed the repository and site link to a more user-friendly name: "Password-Generator". 
2. Additionally, I made three more detailed commits to the main repository.
3. Furthermore, I've enriched the README file with additional details and pushed the changes to the repository.

The "Password-Generator" encompasses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functionalities.
In the JavaScript code, I've revamped variable names to enhance their clarity:

  var lowercaseCharacters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
  var uppercaseCharacters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
  var numericCharacters = "0123456789";
  var specialCharacters = "!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~"


Upon clicking the "Generate Password" button, the application validates the following conditions:

Checks if any input values are empty or if the cancel button was pressed.
Validates if the input is an integer.
Ensures that the password length is between 8 and 128 characters.
Prompts the user to select character types:


  var selectlowercaseCharacters = confirm("Do You want to Include lowercase characters?");
  var selectuppercaseCharacters = confirm("Do You want to Include uppercase characters?");
  var selectnumericCharacters = confirm("Do You want toInclude numeric characters?");
  var selectspecialCharacters = confirm("Do You want to Include special characters?");

Subsequently, the application verifies if at least one character type is selected.

Once all validations are successful, the randomly generated "password" is passed and displayed on the main page.
